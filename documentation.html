    <h2>Why One API Request</h2>

    <p>When I decided to send only one API request for this project, the main reason was that the website is a
      prototype.
      As such, it wasn't necessary to include multiple API requests at this stage. The goal of this project is to
      demonstrate the concept and functionality rather than to have a fully-fledged, high-performance website. By
      keeping
      the requests minimal, I was able to focus on the core functionality of the site while keeping the development
      process manageable.</p>

    <p>Additionally, since the site is still in its early stages, I wanted to ensure that I wasnâ€™t overcomplicating
      things
      or adding unnecessary costs. One request was sufficient to generate the necessary content for the prototype, and
      it
      allowed me to test out the structure and interactive features without worrying about the overhead of additional
      API
      calls.</p>

    <p>Moving forward, I plan to enhance the site interactively and visually. Once the core elements are established, I
      can expand the functionality with more dynamic content and interactive features. For now, keeping it simple with
      just one request enables me to focus on the design and usability of the site, while saving resources for future
      enhancements.</p>
