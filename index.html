  <h2>A Simulation of Data and Power</h2>
  <h3>In an age where data is the new currency, who controls your personal information? Explore the complex relationship
    between government surveillance, corporate data collection, and individual privacy in this interactive simulation.
  </h3>

  <h3>The privacy paradox refers to the tension between the desire for personal privacy and the need to share personal
    data for convenience, safety, or economic benefits. In our modern world, we willingly trade privacy for services,
    but the implications of this trade are often unknown.</h3>

  <h3>In this simulation, you can adjust privacy settings for different groups (government, corporations, and
    individuals). The power distribution between these groups will shift based on your choices, and you’ll see how it
    impacts society, economy, and privacy.</h3>

  <h3><strong>How Does It Work?</strong></h3>
  <p>The simulation allows you to make critical decisions about data privacy in a futuristic society. You will be able
    to control how much information is shared with governments, corporations, and individuals. As you make these
    decisions, watch how the balance of power shifts between these groups, affecting the world’s economy, social
    structure, and the well-being of its citizens.</p>

  <h3><strong>What Will You Choose?</strong></h3>
  <p>Will you empower the government to collect more data in the name of security? Or will you protect the privacy of
    individuals, even at the cost of economic efficiency? Your choices will have real consequences, affecting everything
    from healthcare access to corporate dominance in the market.</p>

  <h3><strong>Why Does Privacy Matter?</strong></h3>
  <p>As governments and corporations increase their reach into our personal lives, it’s more important than ever to
    understand the trade-offs we make for convenience. Do we give up some privacy for personalized services? How do we
    protect vulnerable groups from being exploited by mass data collection? This simulation asks you to think critically
    about these questions and consider the consequences of your actions.</p>

  <h3><strong>Start the Simulation:</strong></h3>
  <p>Ready to dive in? Start making decisions and watch the world unfold based on your privacy choices. What kind of
    society will you create?</p>
